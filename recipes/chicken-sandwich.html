        <ul><li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>12 dill pickle slices, with brine</li>
            <li>peanut oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon celery salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
            <li>6 sandwich buns</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place each chicken breast between two sheets of heavy plastic 
                on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth 
                side of a meat mallet to an even thickness. Cut each breast in 
                half and place in a bowl. Pour pickle brine on top and let sit 
                for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, mix flour, powdered sugar, salt, paprika, pepper, 
                celery salt, and basil in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs and milk together in another bowl.</li>
            <li>Drain liquid from the chicken and rinse off briefly. 
                Shake any excess liquid from chicken.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Dip each piece of chicken into the flour mixture, then into the 
                egg-milk mixture, then coat again with the flour. Dip each piece again, if desired.</li>
            <li>Deep-fry chicken, a few pieces at a time, until golden brown, 
                2 to 3 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted 
                into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Let chicken rest on a cooling rack set over a baking sheet for 5 minutes. 
                While chicken is resting, lightly butter each sandwich bun 
                and toast them in a skillet.</li>
            <li>Add 2 pickle slices to the bottom of each bun, then a chicken piece, 
                then top with the other bun. Repeat to make remaining sandwiches.</li>
        </ol>
